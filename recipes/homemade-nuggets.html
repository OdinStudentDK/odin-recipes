    <h2>How do I make homemade nuggets?</h2>

    <h3><strong>A brief overview</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken breasts into nuggets.</li>
        <li>Mix the bread crumbs, cheese, and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Dip the nuggets in melted butter, then coat them in the bread crumb mixture. </li>
        <li>Bake until the chicken is brown and cooked through. </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><strong>A few tips</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can make these chicken nuggets in your air fryer, just follow the recipe, but <strong>cut the cook time in half</strong>. </li>
        <li>Use this recipe as a guide. You can flavor them however you like. I suggest adding cayenne pepper for spicy nuggets or leave out the seasonings all together for a plain version. </li>
        <li>I recommend flipping the nuggets halfway through the cook time, as one side may get crispier than the other. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>STEP 1</strong></p>
    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
    <p><strong>STEP 2</strong></p>
    Cut chicken breasts into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, thyme, and salt together well in a medium bowl. Put melted butter in a bowl or dish for dipping.
    <p><strong>STEP 3</strong></p>
    Dip chicken pieces into the melted butter first, then coat with the bread crumb mixture. Place the well-coated chicken nuggets on a lightly greased cookie sheet in a single layer.
    <p><strong>STEP 4</strong></p>
    <p>Bake nuggets in the preheated oven until browned and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes.</p>
