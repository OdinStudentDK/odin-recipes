    <h2>How do I make a pepperoni pizza?</h2>
    <p><strong>Preheat a pizza stone in the oven</strong> (on the center rack) to 475°F or to the oven safe temperature as directed by your pizza stone.</p>
    <p><strong>Add half the flour</strong> to the center of a large cutting board or flat surface, and spread it around to lightly dust the surface with flour. Add the other half of the flour to the corner of the cutting board to use as you stretch the dough.</p>
    <p><strong>Stretch pizza dough</strong> by adding the raw pizza to the floured surface. Flip it against the surface a few times to pick up flour. Then start pinching outside 1” of the pizza dough, in a circular motion, to outline the crust and start getting the dough in a circle shape. Then alternate between pressing the center of the dough against the cutting board, and using the back of your knuckles to stretch the dough from underneath, pulling it outwards in a circular motion. <strong>Dusting the pizza dough along the way</strong> with the extra flour helps it retain a larger size instead of shrinking back up to a ball. Use as many different techniques as needed to stretch the dough.</p>
    <p><strong>Carefully take the hot pizza stone</strong> out of the oven once it has preheated, and quickly brush half of the olive oil on the top of the pizza stone. Add the raw stretched pizza dough on top, and brush the rest of the olive oil along the outside 1” of the pizza crust (to give it a golden brown crust once baked).</p>
    <p><strong>Work quickly to assemble pepperoni pizza toppings</strong> (to get it back in the oven quickly). Add the pizza sauce and spread it around the pizza, leaving 1” without sauce for the pizza crust around the outside of the circle. Top with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni slices, and half the parmesan cheese.</p>
    <p><strong>Bake pepperoni pizza on pizza stone for 10-15 minutes</strong> at 475°F, until cheese is melted and bubbling on the top, and the bottom and crust has turned golden brown.</p>
    <p><strong>To</strong> and top with fresh parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves as desired. Slice and serve when cool enough to eat.</p>
